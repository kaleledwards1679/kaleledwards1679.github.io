      <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p> 
          Welcome to the website of your dreams, as long as when you go to bed you dream of a 17 year old's computer science projects, and who wouldn't?
        </p>
      
      <h2>Just How Great is <br> Coding?</h2>
        <p>
          Since I don't want this turning into a personal blog I figured I should ramble a bit about how friggin awesome it feels to code a website. So far it is awesome, and I'm just a few CSS lessons away from making this thing shine. For more info on coding go to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>
        </p>
        <!-- Sorry for the change in style on these, I just hoped I could do what I want with the website a bit while still adding stuff like the line break.-->

           <!-- started and stopped the hyperlink refrence before and after the and to visually link the games because of their similarities but let "and" not at actually be a link to either game. Question, does the red "li" and "a" at the end mean anything? It seems to work fine. -->
